# MATH 189: Mathematical Data Science & Topic Modeling

Prof. Jamie Haddock, <jhaddock@g.hmc.edu>

In this course, students will learn about common mathematical representations of data, the mathematical foundations of matrix factorization and tensor decomposition, and their application to many tasks in machine learning and data science.  These decomposition techniques are integral tools in studying large-scale and multi-modal data and form the basis for many approaches to the topic modeling, dimension reduction, and clustering tasks.  Potential topics include PCA, nonnegative matrix factorization, higher-order SVD, nonnegative tensor decompositions, K-means clustering, optimization techniques for these models, and applications in machine learning, data science, signal processing, and network science.


## AIMS FOR THE COURSE

In this course, we will engage with current mathematical and data scientific research.  It has been designed to strengthen your skills in reading and analyzing research papers, and writing and presenting your own research.


## READING ASSIGNMENTS

Reading assignments are the primary way that you will engage with course content outside of lecture.  These readings serve several important purposes, including to introduce you to state-of-the-art techniques in the field and to develop competency in reading academic papers.

Reading will be assigned weekly and each reading has two components.

The first part is the active reading of the assigned article. You will access the assigned reading via Google Classroom, and then you will engage in active reading of the article via annotations and discussions in Google.

The second part is a short-answer reflection that will be accessed via Gradescope. The overview focuses on big-picture concepts and mathematical ideas from the article and should be completed after you have finished the active reading. You will submit this part directly to Gradescope.

Using Gradescope: If you are registered for this course, you should have already been added to the Gradescope class page. Contact your instructor if you are having problems with access. Gradescope has several tutorial resources, e.g., [Gradescope video tutorials](https://www.gradescope.com/get_started#student-submission).

## FINAL PROJECT
Our final project will be a group project (consisting of 3-4 students per team) focused on a topic of the team's choosing.  The project components will be the required parts of a mock (or perhaps real!) submission to the nice annual IEEE conference ["Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers"](https://www.asilomarsscconf.org/).  These are a 100â200 word abstract, an extended summary (500â1000 words plus figures), a technical presentation, and a full paper (5-8 pages).  Like the conference, you will submit the abstract and extended summary in advance of your group final presentation, and the final paper after your presentation.
